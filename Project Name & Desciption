1. Predicting Breast Cancer using SVM

I used the sk-learn builtin dataset called load_breast_cancer. 
I try to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer using various medical features such as mean radius, mean concavity, worst fractal dimension, etc. 
I then used the Support Vector Machine Algorithm to develop a model to predict the test dataset.

2. Predicting Flowers Class using SVM

I used a built-in seaborn iris dataset which has 3 classes and
I tried to predict them using various, input features such as sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. 
i then use the SVM algorithm to develop a hyper-plane to distinguish the 3 classes.
